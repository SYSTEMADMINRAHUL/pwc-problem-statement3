yes  When you're traveling for business, keeping track of your expenses can be a hassle. But it doesn't need to be. Thanks to expense tracking apps, you can now stay on top of your finances as you go along.

While almost all expense tracking apps will allow you to manually enter your incoming and outgoing transactions, additional features can vary widely. Some apps come with handy receipt scanners that auto-extract receipt information, while others allow you to synchronize your financial data with your credit card and/or bank accounts. Exporting expense reports is another common feature; some apps let you save to other formats, such as Excel, QuickBooks or PDF, while others let you sync with cloud storage services like Dropbox.

While the simpler apps tend to be free, the more comprehensive ones, including those that are destined for more than one user, usually charge either a one-time or a recurring fee.
Expenditure provides a simple and intuitive interface for recording both expenses and income. Adding a new transaction is fast and easy: Enter the amount and select whether it is an expense (red button) or income (green button). If your transaction takes place in a different currency, the app can convert it for you, a feature that is particularly useful for business travelers.
